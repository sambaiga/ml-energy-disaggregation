    Top-left: Tibshirani and Walther's prediction strength, drawn as an

    B's own points, and B's own pairs either agree or they do not.
    Top-right: Hennig's cluster-wise stability, the same underlying idea
    run the other way: a fragile, near-singleton cluster C sits inside
    the full data, survives (or does not) a bootstrap resample, and gets
    scored by how much of itself it recovers. Bottom: the two mechanisms'
    own real verdicts on this book's own data, prediction strength
    comfortably above Tibshirani and Walther's 0.8-0.9 cutoff for London
